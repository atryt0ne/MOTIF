# How Expressive are Knowledge Graph Foundation Models? #

This is the official codebase for [**How Expressive are Knowledge Graph Foundation Models?**](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.13339) (ICML 2025), which is heavily imported from the code base of [ULTRA](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/ULTRA).

MOTIF is a knowledge graph foundation model framework capable of equipping with arbitrary motifs for inductive (on nodes and relations) link prediction with knowledge graphs. It leverages [HCNets](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HCNet) as relation encoders and [NBFNets](https://github.com/KiddoZhu/NBFNet-PyG) as entity encoders.


## Installation ##

You may install the dependencies via pip. 
If you are on a Mac, you may omit the CUDA toolkit requirements.

## Synthetic experiments ##

We include the synthetic experiments shown in the paper in `Synthetic_experiment.ipynb` on different variants of *ConnectHub* datasets.

## Checkpoints ##

We provide one pre-trained ULTRA checkpoint and one pre-trained MOTIF checkpoint with 3-path and 2-path motifs in the `/ckpts` folder (6-layer GNNs per relation and entity graphs, 64d) trained on 2 x A100 GPUs with this codebase:
* `ultra_3g.pth`: trained on `FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium` for 800,000 steps, config is in `/config/transductive/ULTRA_pretrain_3g.yaml`
* `motif_3g.pth`: trained on `FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium` for 40,000 steps, config is in `/config/transductive/MOTIF_pretrain_3g.yaml`

You can use those checkpoints for zero-shot inference on any graph (including your own) or use it as a backbone for fine-tuning. 


## Run Inference and Fine-tuning

The `/scripts` folder contains 3 executable files:
* `run.py` - run an experiment on a single dataset
* `run_many.py` - run experiments on several datasets sequentially and dump results into a CSV file
* `pretrain.py` - a script for pre-training MOTIF and ULTRA on several graphs

The yaml configs in the `config` folder are provided for both `transductive` and `inductive` datasets.

### Run a single experiment

The `run.py` command requires the following arguments:
* `-c <yaml config>`: a path to the yaml config
* `--dataset`: dataset name (from the list of [datasets](#datasets))
* `--version`: a version of the inductive dataset (see all in [datasets](#datasets)), not needed for transductive graphs. For example, `--dataset FB15k237Inductive --version v1` will load one of the GraIL inductive datasets.
* `--epochs`: number of epochs to train, `--epochs 0` means running zero-shot inference.
* `--bpe`: batches per epoch (replaces the length of the dataloader as default value). `--bpe 100 --epochs 10` means that each epoch consists of 100 batches, and overall training is 1000 batches. Set `--bpe null` to use the full length dataloader or comment the `bpe` line in the yaml configs.
* `--gpus`: number of gpu devices, set to `--gpus null` when running on CPUs, `--gpus [0]` for a single GPU, or otherwise set the number of GPUs for a [distributed setup](#distributed-setup)
* `--ckpt`: **full** path to the one of the MOTIF checkpoints to use (you can use those provided in the repo ot trained on your own). Use `--ckpt null` to start training from scratch (or run zero-shot inference on a randomly initialized model, it still might surprise you and demonstrate non-zero performance).

Zero-shot inference setup is `--epochs 0` with a given checkpoint `ckpt`.

Fine-tuning of a checkpoint is when epochs > 0 with a given checkpoint.


An example command for an inductive dataset to run on a CPU: 

```bash
python script/run.py -c config/inductive/MOTIF_inference.yaml --dataset FB15k237Inductive --version v1 --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus null --ckpt /path/to/MOTIF/ckpts/motif_3g.pth 
```

An example command for a transductive dataset to run on a GPU:
```bash
python script/run.py -c config/transductive/MOTIF_inference.yaml --dataset CoDExSmall --epochs 0 --bpe null --gpus [0] --ckpt /path/to/MOTIF/ckpts/motif_3g.pth 
```

### Run on many datasets

The `run_many.py` script is a convenient way to run evaluation (0-shot inference and fine-tuning) on several datasets sequentially. Upon completion, the script will generate a csv file `MOTIF_results_<timestamp>` with the test set results and chosen metrics. 
Using the same config files, you only need to specify:

* `-c <yaml config>`: use the full path to the yaml config because workdir will be reset after each dataset; 
* `-d, --datasets`: a comma-separated list of [datasets](#datasets) to run, inductive datasets use the `name:version` convention. For example, `-d ILPC2022InductiveSmall:small,ILPC2022InductiveLarge:large`;
* `--ckpt`: MOTIF checkpoint to run the experiments on, use the **full** path to the file;
* `--gpus`: the same as in [run single](#run-a-single-experiment);
* `-reps` (optional): number of repeats with different seeds, set by default to 1 for zero-shot inference;
* `-ft, --finetune` (optional): use the finetuning configs of MOTIF (`default_finetuning_config`) to fine-tune a given checkpoint for specified `epochs` and `bpe`;
* `-tr, --train` (optional): train MOTIF from scratch on the target dataset taking `epochs` and `bpe` parameters from another pre-defined config (`default_train_config`);
* `--epochs` and `--bpe` will be set according to a configuration, by default they are set for a 0-shot inference.

An example command to run 0-shot inference evaluation of a MOTIF checkpoint on 4 FB GraIL datasets:

```bash
python script/run_many.py -c /path/to/config/inductive/MOTIF_inference.yaml --gpus [0] --ckpt /path/to/MOTIF/ckpts/motif_3g.pth -d FB15k237Inductive:v1,FB15k237Inductive:v2,FB15k237Inductive:v3,FB15k237Inductive:v4
```

An example command to run fine-tuning on 4 FB GraIL datasets with 5 different seeds:

```bash
python script/run_many.py -c /path/to/config/inductive/MOTIF_inference.yaml --gpus [0] --ckpt /path/to/MOTIF/ckpts/motif_3g.pth --finetune --reps 5 -d FB15k237Inductive:v1,FB15k237Inductive:v2,FB15k237Inductive:v3,FB15k237Inductive:v4
```

### Pretraining

Run the pre-training script `pretrain.py` with the `config/transductive/MOTIF_pretrain_3g.yaml` config file. 

`graphs` in the config specify the pre-training mixture: `pretrain_3g.yaml` uses FB15k237, WN18RR, CoDExMedium. By default, we use the training option `fast_test: 500` to run faster evaluation on a random subset of 500 triples (that approximates full validation performance) of each validation set of the pre-training mixture.
You can change the pre-training length by varying batches per epoch `batch_per_epoch` and `epochs` hyperparameters.


An example command to start pre-training on 3 graphs:

```bash
python script/pretrain.py -c config/transductive/MOTIF_pretrain_3g.yaml --gpus [0] 
```

Pre-training can be computationally heavy, you might need to decrease the batch size for smaller GPU RAM. The two provided checkpoints were trained on 2 x A100 (40 GB).

#### Distributed setup
To run MOTIF and ULTRA with multiple GPUs, use the following commands (eg, 4 GPUs per node)

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 script/pretrain.py -c /config/transductive/MOTIF_pretrain_3g.yaml --gpus [0,1,2,3]
```

## Datasets

The repo packs 57 different KG datasets of sizes from 1K-120K nodes and 1K-2M edges. Inductive datasets have splits of different `version` and a common notation is `dataset:version`, eg `ILPC2022InductiveSmall:small`.

Note that we cannot carry full expeirments on transductive datasets for MOTIF since the size of constructed meta-graphs is too big and does not fit in the memory.
